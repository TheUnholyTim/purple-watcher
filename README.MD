# This is the main repository and where I'll be logging the progress of my first game. Our main concept here is to:

<div>
<p>{} create an old school like experience for horror games, inspired by OG clock tower</p>

<p>{} I also need to develop some professional skills and that sounds like the best /coa/ </p>

<p>{} I'm really trying to get used to EMACS so... that's a bonus I guess. </p>

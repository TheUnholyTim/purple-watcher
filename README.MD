# This is the main repository and where I'll be logging the progress of my first game. Our main concept here is to:
{} create an old school like experience for horror games, inspired by OG clock tower
{} I also need to develop some professional skills and that sounds like the best /coa/
{} I'm really trying to get used to EMACS so... that's a bonus I guess.

Other medias that can be found about this project are:
# Tumblr
  - purple-watcher.tumblr.com

# Twitter
  - Maybe in the future I'll create an account to interact with you people about our developments

# Personal domain blog
  - maybe in the future as well.
